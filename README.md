## Financial Features & Usage Guide

FinanceApp keeps every market workflow behind authenticated screens. Each section below explains what a feature does and how to operate it in practice.

### Dashboard overview

- **What it does**: Shows total companies tracked, price points ingested, news signals, and dividend coverage. Company cards highlight intraday movement, latest close, and coverage counts.
- **How to use it**: Sign in and land on /. Use the search bar to filter by company name, ticker symbol, industry keywords, or ISIN. Tap any card to open the detailed company view.

### Company deep dive

- **What it does**: Presents historical price charts, optional five-day forecasts, market comparisons, and sentiment summaries. Supports on-demand dividend retrieval and curated news with sentiment badges.
- **How to use it**: Click a company card from the dashboard or watchlist. Use the design controls to toggle forecasting or market comparison modules. Press "Load dividends" to fetch the latest payout history when needed.

### Watchlists

- **What it does**: Organises tickers (including ETFs) into named lists with inline editing and ETF badges.
- **How to use it**: Navigate to /settings, open the Watchlists panel, and create or rename a list. Add instruments by entering a ticker or ISIN; the backend normalises case and resolves new companies automatically.

### Portfolio analytics

- **What it does**: Stores holdings, calculates weightings, and offers an equal-weight optimiser that refreshes derived stats.
- **How to use it**: In /settings, open the Portfolios section. Select a portfolio, add tickers with desired weights, then trigger the optimiser to rebalance or refresh analytics.

### Price alerts

- **What it does**: Watches price thresholds (above or below) and emits a single email per breach each day.
- **How to use it**: In settings, scroll to Price Alerts, supply the ticker or ISIN, choose direction and threshold, then save. Keep the cron task active (see below) so alerts evaluate during scheduled refreshes.

### Email notifications

- **What it does**: Manages opt-in preferences for market intelligence, sentiment changes, and price alerts.
- **How to use it**: Visit the Notifications panel in settings. Toggle the switches to decide which alert types send emails; preferences persist per user.

### API key vault

- **What it does**: Encrypts Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI, and Hugging Face credentials so the app can enrich market data, sentiment, and forecasts.
- **How to use it**: In settings, expand the API Keys section. Paste provider keys, save, and the app validates reachability before encrypting values at rest.

### Feature toggles

- **What it does**: Controls optional analytics (forecasting, market comparisons, sentiment overlays, portfolio metrics) per device without affecting other sessions.
- **How to use it**: Use the palette icon in the header or the Feature Controls card in settings. Enable or disable individual modules; dashboard and company views update instantly.

### Automated data refresh

- **What it does**: A scheduled job ingests new prices, news, sentiment, and executes price alerts so the dashboard stays current.
- **How to use it**: Deploy a cron trigger that POSTs to /api/cron/refresh-data with CRON_SECRET in the header. The docs/ folder includes examples for common schedulers.

### ISIN-aware search

- **What it does**: Lets every search input (dashboard, watchlists, price alerts) resolve instruments by ISIN in addition to ticker symbols.
- **How to use it**: Enter the 12-character ISIN in any search field. FinanceApp strips formatting, resolves or creates the company record, and renders it just like a standard ticker.

## üìä Settings & Data Management

- **Watchlists** - Create lists, rename them inline, remove symbols on the fly, and we still auto-badge ETFs for clarity.
- **Portfolios** - Manage holdings with ticker lookup, adjust weights, delete entries, and run the equal-weight optimiser to refresh analytics.
- **Feature controls** - Decide whether predictive forecasting, market comparisons, portfolio analytics, and sentiment overlays appear; preferences are stored per device.
- **API Keys** ‚Äì Save encrypted credentials for Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI, and Hugging Face with validation feedback.
- **Email Notifications** ‚Äì Toggle alerts on/off; settings persist in `notification_preferences`.
- **Price Alerts** ‚Äì Configure thresholds and direction. Alerts queue during cron refresh and email once per day per trigger.
- **Inline Help** ‚Äì Tooltips handle quick hints (watchlists/portfolios) while hover cards give richer explanations (email notifications, price alerts).

---

## üîê Authentication Notes

1. **Google OAuth** ‚Äì Configure in Google Cloud console and set redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (or your production domain).
2. **Email allowlist** ‚Äì Production deployments should set `ALLOWED_EMAILS` to restrict access to specific addresses.
3. **Public pages** ‚Äì `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service` remain accessible without authentication.

---

## üåê External APIs

### Financial Data ‚Äì Alpha Vantage
- Free tier (5 calls/min, 500/day) is sufficient for the cron cadence.
- Fallback to Yahoo Finance is used when Alpha Vantage is unavailable.

### News ‚Äì NewsAPI
- Fetches English articles per company to populate dashboards & watchlists.

### Sentiment Analysis ‚Äì Hugging Face
- Uses `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` for cost-effective polarity checks.
- Also powers H/F API key validation by calling a test inference.

---

## ‚è± Cron Job

Schedule every 4 hours (Hostinger, Vercel Cron, GitHub Action, etc.) to hit the refresh endpoint:

```bash
curl --silent --show-error \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/cron/refresh-data
```

The handler refreshes prices, ingests news, runs sentiment, and evaluates stored price alerts in one pass.

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a detailed walkthrough of modules, service boundaries, and background jobs. Highlights:

- `app/settings/page.tsx` orchestrates client-side forms and fetches.
- `/app/api/user/**` endpoints guard input and call Prisma-backed services in `lib/services`.
- `prisma/schema.prisma` models notification preferences & price alerts alongside watchlists/portfolios.
- `app/api/cron/refresh-data/route.ts` pulls third-party data and dispatches alerts.

### Key Prisma models

```prisma
model NotificationPreference {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String   @unique
  emailEnabled Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model PriceAlert {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId        String
  companyId     Int
  direction     String   // "above" or "below"
  threshold     Float
  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  lastTriggered DateTime?
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  user    User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  company Company @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([userId, companyId, direction, threshold])
}
```

## üîê Security & Best Practices

- All secrets live in environment variables; never commit `.env`.
- Auth middleware protects every non-public route.
- Prisma uses parameterized queries, reducing SQL injection risk.
- Input validation is performed server-side for all API routes.
- Sensitive values (API keys) are AES-encrypted before hitting the database.
